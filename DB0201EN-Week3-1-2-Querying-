Lab: Access DB2 on Cloud using Python
Introduction
This notebook illustrates how to access your database instance using Python by following the steps below:

Import the ibm_db Python library
Identify and enter the database connection credentials
Create the database connection
Create a table
Insert data into the table
Query data from the table
Retrieve the result set into a pandas dataframe
Close the database connection
Notice: Please follow the instructions given in the first Lab of this course to Create a database service instance of Db2 on Cloud.

Task 1: Import the ibm_db Python library
The ibm_db API provides a variety of useful Python functions for accessing and manipulating data in an IBM® data server database, including functions for connecting to a database, preparing and issuing SQL statements, fetching rows from result sets, calling stored procedures, committing and rolling back transactions, handling errors, and retrieving metadata.

We import the ibm_db library into our Python Application


import ibm_db
When the command above completes, the ibm_db library is loaded in your notebook.

Task 2: Identify the database connection credentials
Connecting to dashDB or DB2 database requires the following information:

Driver Name
Database name
Host DNS name or IP address
Host port
Connection protocol
User ID
User Password
Notice: To obtain credentials please refer to the instructions given in the first Lab of this course

Now enter your database credentials below

Replace the placeholder values in angular brackets <> below with your actual database credentials

e.g. replace "< database >" with "BLUDB"


dsn_driver = "{IBM DB2 ODBC DRIVER}"
dsn_database = "<BLUDB>"            # e.g. "BLUDB"
dsn_hostname = "<dashdb-txn-sbox-yp-lon02-01.services.eu-gb.bluemix.net>" # e.g.: "awh-yp-small03.services.dal.bluemix.net"
dsn_port = "<50000>"                # e.g. "50000" 
dsn_protocol = "<TCPIP>"            # i.e. "TCPIP"
dsn_uid = "<jnw28361>"        # e.g. "dash104434"
dsn_pwd = "<jt^8l7k60rrkh544>"       # e.g. "7dBZ3wWt9xN6$o0JiX!m"

## Task 3: Create the database connection
​
Ibm_db API uses the IBM Data Server Driver for ODBC and CLI APIs to connect to IBM DB2 and Informix.
​
​
Create the database connection
​

#Create database connection
dsn = (
    "DRIVER={0};"
    "DATABASE={1};"
    "HOSTNAME={2};"
    "PORT={3};"
    "PROTOCOL={4};"
    "UID={5};"
    "PWD={6};").format(dsn_driver, dsn_database, dsn_hostname, dsn_port, dsn_protocol, dsn_uid, dsn_pwd)
​
try:
    conn = ibm_db.connect(dsn, "jnw28361", "jt^8l7k60rrkh544")
    print ("Connected!")
​
except:
    print ("Unable to connect to database")
​
​
Unable to connect to database

## Task 4: Create a table in the database
​
In this step we will create a table in the database with following details:

​

#Lets first drop the table INSTRUCTOR in case it exists from a previous attempt
dropQuery = "drop table INSTRUCTOR"
​
#Now execute the drop statment
dropStmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, dropQuery)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-21-83413676a2ca> in <module>
      3 
      4 #Now execute the drop statment
----> 5 dropStmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, dropQuery)

NameError: name 'ibm_db' is not defined
Dont worry
if you see an exception/error similar to the following, indicating that INSTRUCTOR is an undefined name, that's okay. It just implies that the INSTRUCTOR table does not exist in the table - which would be the case if you had not created it previously.

Exception: [IBM][CLI Driver][DB2/LINUXX8664] SQL0204N "DASH1234.INSTRUCTOR" is an undefined name. SQLSTATE=42704 SQLCODE=-204


#Construct the Create Table DDL statement - replace the ... with rest of the statement
createQuery = "create table INSTRUCTOR(id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY NOT NULL, fname ...)"
​
#Now fill in the name of the method and execute the statement
createStmt = ibm_db.<insert_name_of_execution_method>(conn, createQuery)

Task 5: Insert data into the table
In this step we will insert some rows of data into the table.

The INSTRUCTOR table we created in the previous step contains 3 rows of data:

Image
We will start by inserting just the first row of data, i.e. for instructor Rav Ahuja


#Construct the query - replace ... with the insert statement
insertQuery = "insert into INSTRUCTOR values(1, 'Rav', 'Ahuja', 'TORONTO', 'CA')"
​
#execute the insert statement
insertStmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, insertQuery)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
<ipython-input-4-27abc64fa21a> in <module>
      3 
      4 #execute the insert statement
----> 5 insertStmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, insertQuery)

NameError: name 'ibm_db' is not defined

Now use a single query to insert the remaining two rows of data


#replace ... with the insert statement that inerts the remaining two rows of data
insertQuery2 = "..."
​
#execute the statement
insertStmt2 = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, insertQuery2)

Task 6: Query data in the table
In this step we will retrieve data we inserted into the INSTRUCTOR table.


#Construct the query that retrieves all rows from the INSTRUCTOR table
selectQuery = "select * from INSTRUCTOR"
​
#Execute the statement
selectStmt = ibm_db.exec_immediate(conn, selectQuery)
​
#Fetch the Dictionary (for the first row only) - replace ... with your code
...
Double-click here for the solution.


#Fetch the rest of the rows and print the ID and FNAME for those rows
while ibm_db.fetch_row(selectStmt) != False:
   print (" ID:",  ibm_db.result(selectStmt, 0), " FNAME:",  ibm_db.result(selectStmt, "FNAME"))

Bonus: now write and execute an update statement that changes the Rav's CITY to MOOSETOWN


#Enter your code below
​
Double-click here for the solution.

Task 7: Retrieve data into Pandas
In this step we will the contents of the INSTRUCTOR table into a Pandas dataframe


import pandas
import ibm_db_dbi

#connection for pandas
pconn = ibm_db_dbi.Connection(conn)

#query statement to retrieve all rows in INSTRUCTOR table
selectQuery = "select * from INSTRUCTOR"
​
#retrieve the query results into a pandas dataframe
pdf = pandas.read_sql(selectQuery, pconn)
​
#print just the LNAME for first row in the pandas data frame
pdf.LNAME[0]

#print the entire data frame
pdf
Once the data is in a Pandas dataframe, you can do the typical pandas operations on it.

For example you can use the shape method to see how many rows and columns are in the dataframe


pdf.shape
Task 8: Close the Connection
We free all resources by closing the connection. Remember that it is always important to close connections so that we can avoid unused connections taking up resources.


ibm_db.close(conn)
Summary
In this tutorial you established a connection to a database instance of DB2 Warehouse on Cloud from a Python notebook using ibm_db API. Then created a table and insert a few rows of data into it. Then queried the data. You also retrieved the data into a pandas dataframe.
